## Modules
1. **Air Quality (PM2.5 Biofilters)**  
   Predicts pollution reduction using enzyme filters.

2. **Ocean Microplastics (PETase-based Degradation)**  
   Forecasts plastic decay with microbial remediation.

3. **Malaria Control (Gene Drive Strategy)**  
   Simulates population-wide disease suppression via engineered vectors.

## Outputs
- Graphs (PM2.5 reduction, plastic decay, malaria trend)
- Summary results (.csv format)
- Ready for integration with posters, Colab notebooks, or scientific dissemination.
