# Digital Twin Framework for Predictive Environmental & Health Interventions

This repository hosts an original, high-impact computational model simulating real-world outcomes of synthetic biological interventions across three domains:

## 🔬 Modules
1. **Air Quality (PM2.5 Biofilters)**  
   Predicts pollution reduction using enzyme filters.

2. **Ocean Microplastics (PETase-based Degradation)**  
   Forecasts plastic decay with microbial remediation.

3. **Malaria Control (Gene Drive Strategy)**  
   Simulates population-wide disease suppression via engineered vectors.

## 📈 Outputs
- Graphs (PM2.5 reduction, plastic decay, malaria trend)
- Summary results (.csv format)
- Ready for integration with posters, Colab notebooks, or scientific dissemination.

## 🧠 Built for:
- Environmental scientists
- Synthetic biology researchers
- Policymakers evaluating safe intervention strategies
